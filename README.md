# 3D Pathfinding with Obstacles

This repository contains code for solving the problem of finding the shortest path on a 3D terrain grid while navigating around obstacles. The solution utilizes the A* search algorithm and provides visualizations of the optimal path in both heatmap and 3D plot formats.

# Problem Description

The problem involves navigating from a start point to a goal point on a 3D terrain grid. Each point on the grid represents a location with a specific height, and certain points are designated as obstacles. The objective is to find the shortest path from the start to the goal point while avoiding these obstacles.


# Solution Overview

The solution employs the A* search algorithm, a popular pathfinding algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in finding the shortest path in a graph. A heuristic function is used to guide the search towards the goal while considering the terrain's topology and the presence of obstacles.
